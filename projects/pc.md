### How Building PCs Ignited My Passion for Technology

Building my first PC was a game-changer for me. What began as a way to save money quickly turned into a deep fascination with technology.

When I put together my computer, I was amazed by how all the different parts worked together—like the CPU, RAM, and motherboard. Figuring out how to make everything fit and work was a challenging puzzle that I enjoyed solving. Each step, from installing the hardware to troubleshooting issues, made me more curious about how computers function.

This experience opened my eyes to the world of technology. I realized that understanding hardware was just the start. I wanted to learn more about how software and programming make computers do what they do. So, I started studying programming and learning about computer science.

Building PCs didn’t just teach me technical skills; it sparked a passion for technology and set me on a path to explore computer science further. It showed me how exciting and rewarding it can be to solve problems and create new things with technology.

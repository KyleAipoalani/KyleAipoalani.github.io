### Impact of PC's in my passion for technology

Building my first PC was a game-changer for me. What began as a way to play my favorite games on a desktop turned into a deep fascination with technology.

When I put together my computer, I was amazed by how all the different parts worked together (like the CPU, GPU, RAM, motherboard, etc). Figuring out which parts to purchase and how to make everything fit and work together optimally was a challenging puzzle that I enjoyed solving. Each step, from installing the hardware to troubleshooting issues, made me more curious about how computers function.

This experience opened my eyes to the world of technology. I realized that understanding hardware was just the start. I wanted to learn more about how software and programming make computers do what they do. So, I started studying programming and learning about computer science.

Building PCs didnâ€™t just teach me technical skills; it sparked a passion for technology and set me on a path to explore computer science further. It showed me how exciting and rewarding it can be to solve problems and create new things with technology.

### Prior experience
  With having no experience whatsoever in Typescript, I am thoroughly enjoying the learning process. So far I have only been primarily exposed to Java for 2 semesters, as well as only 1 semester’s worth of learning C. So with the programming knowledge that I’ve gained throughout my academic career, that has helped me to better digest this new language. Although, since typescript is fairly complex it's been slightly difficult to get used to the syntax. 

### Typescript from a software engineer's perspective
  I believe that Typescript is a good programming language, especially from a software engineering perspective, because of not only its versatility with it being 100% valid with javascript but also helps with catching errors during compilation rather than during a program’s runtime. With static typing, it can aid in having more readable and understandable code and can provide more accurate feedback for any errors that may show up. Also, since it’s adaptable to javascript, it allows better flexibility instead of maybe switching to a different language. 

### ICS314
  Reflecting on the athletic software engineering of ICS314, as intimidating as the WODs may seem at first glance, they are an integral part of not only learning and getting comfortable with the language but fully digesting it and understanding it on a hands-on basis. The most stressful part of the WODs are the time limits but learning to keep pace can help in programming interviews and thinking on the spot or being more creative with your approach to save time. Despite that, I do find it enjoyable.

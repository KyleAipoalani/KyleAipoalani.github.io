#### Introduction #### 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the way we learn by making education more engaging, accessible, and personalized, especially in fields like Software Engineering. In this area, AI tools help students write code more efficiently, solve problems faster, and understand complex topics more easily. During my time in ICS 314, I used AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Claude to assist with coding tasks, debug issues, and to better understand new concepts. These tools provided valuable support this semester, which made it easier to properly process all of the important concepts that were introduced in this fast-paced course.

Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

#### Challenges and Opportunities
One of the challenges I encountered with using AI in the course was programming on a larger scale. When I asked for coding help, I often had to break the problem down into smaller parts so the AI could process it more effectively. This added extra steps to the process and made it harder to work on more complex tasks all at once. While AI is great at handling smaller, specific problems, it can struggle when dealing with large-scale issues that require understanding the bigger picture.
I think there’s also an opportunity to better integrate AI into the course curriculum. Since ICS314 allows the use of AI, it could be helpful to include lessons on how to use AI tools properly and effectively. This could include strategies for breaking down problems, checking AI-generated code for accuracy, and understanding its limitations. Teaching this alongside the core material would not only enhance our understanding of software engineering but also help us develop skills to use AI responsibly and efficiently. AI can act as a good supplementary educational resource, especially when peers, professors, or TAs aren’t available. It provides immediate feedback and support, which is useful for troubleshooting or brainstorming ideas. By incorporating more guidance on AI usage into the course, we could make better use of these tools and gain a deeper understanding of how to combine them with traditional learning methods.

#### Rapidly Changing Times #### 
Speaking of traditional learning methods, times are rapidly changing with so many innovative technologies, so academia needs to start adapting. When comparing traditional teaching methods to AI-enhanced approaches in software engineering education, there are clear differences in engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development. Traditional methods, like lectures and textbooks, often rely on passive learning, which can make it harder for students to stay interested or use concepts in real-world situations. On the other hand, AI tools offer more interactive and personalized experiences, allowing students to learn at their own speed and get quick feedback. For example, an AI tutor can adjust explanations to fit a student’s needs or create practice problems on the spot, making learning more engaging. Traditional methods often focus on memorization, while AI tools promote active problem-solving and applying knowledge, which I think helps students remember things better over time. For practical skill development, AI can simulate coding environments or provide real-time debugging support, something that traditional methods cannot easily do. 
Looking ahead, I think the role of AI in software engineering education will only get bigger. AI could improve to offer even more personalized learning tools, with systems that not only match a student’s skill level but also guide them step by step through complicated projects. However, there will be challenges, like making sure these tools are available to all students and don’t create bigger gaps between those who have access to technology and those who do not. Another issue is the risk of students relying too much on AI for answers without learning to solve problems on their own. To improve, we could work on combining AI tools with traditional teaching methods, so students benefit from both human guidance and AI support. I think the future of AI in education will need a balance where it helps learning but still encourages creativity and independent thinking.

#### Positive Impact #### 
Generative AI tools, more specifically ChatGPT, have made a significant impact, especially as a programmer, and I think there’s both positive and negative sides to how it’s used. On the positive side, these tools are really efficient and easy to use. They save time by helping with things like writing drafts, coming up with ideas, or doing repetitive work. I’ve seen how they can be helpful for learning too, by explaining hard topics, or helping with programming. They also give creative people like writers, designers, and musicians new ways to get ideas or try out something different. Most importantly, I think generative AI makes knowledge and skills available to everyone. It’s also extremely convenient to use and easily accessible, so I think it’s fairly effective as a supplementary learning source especially as a student. In a 314 perspective, the class is very fast-paced, so it’s very easy to get overwhelmed with all of the material being introduced to you at a time. I remember when react was introduced, I was still stuck on the previous week’s curriculum. So with chatGPT explaining things as I followed along with the assignments, I was able to cram a lot of valuable information in which I was probably not going to completely understand in time if I didn’t utilize AI. 

#### Growing concerns #### 
As helpful as tools like AI are, I think there’s some big concerns that are virtually impossible to ignore. Firstly, one of the main problems is that AI can reflect biases from the data it’s trained on, which means it sometimes creates unfair or misleading content. Another thing is that it’s too easy to depend on these tools. If people always use AI to do their work for them, they might lose important skills or stop challenging themselves to learn. I think this is especially true for students who might use AI to finish homework instead of actually understanding the material. There's also the fear that AI will replace jobs, especially ones that involve simple/ repetitive work. This could make it harder for people to start their careers or stay competitive. On top of that, there’s further questions about ethics and fairness. For example, tools that generate AI art often use other people’s work without giving credit, which raises questions about who actually owns what’s created. While workers and programmers might worry about losing their jobs, I think AI is really more of a tool that helps humans rather than replacing them completely. Programmers who use AI as an “assistant” to automate boring tasks and focus on harder problem-solving, will probably stay important in the future. I like to think that AI wont’t replace human thinking, it’ll just make us more efficient and let us focus on bigger and better challenges.

#### Conclusion #### 
Overall, I think generative AI is a powerful tool that has opened up many new opportunities for learning, creating, and working. In software engineering education and beyond, it provides ways to make learning more efficient and optimized. However, its use comes with challenges, such as over-reliance, ethical concerns, and unequal access to technology. Moving forward, I believe it is important to find a balance between AI tools and traditional methods to ensure that people develop not just technical skills but also creativity and critical thinking. If we use AI responsibly and thoughtfully, it has the potential to enhance our abilities, solve problems faster, and create a future where technology and human effort work together harmoniously. And in terms of ICS314 and how it’s structured, I think this was the perfect balance between AI use and traditional teaching, since I mainly used AI as a supplemental tool to help me with problems as they arose and to keep me up to speed when I was behind. Having time to meet in-person as a class also helped a lot in processing this course’s curriculum compared to if it were a strictly online course.

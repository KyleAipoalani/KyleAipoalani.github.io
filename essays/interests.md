### Introduction
As a kid, I’ve always been around computers and technology for as long as I can remember. I’ve always been fascinated by the complexities of how things worked behind the screen. So it was only a matter of time that I would be pursuing a career in a tech field, where I can use that fascination and curiosity to aid me in this professional pursuit. 

### Interests, exploring different fields
Just like many kids growing up in the early 2000s to 2010s, I was drawn to video games as they were rapidly gaining popularity. My dad was already into gaming, so I quickly got hooked as well, and it has remained my main hobby ever since. Being surrounded by video games, I developed a deep interest in creating immersive worlds and digital playgrounds that we can interact with. This has led me to be interested in video game development and 3D graphics.

  Software is a crucial component of both computer science and the modern world. Essential technologies like smartphone applications, airplane piloting systems, operating systems, and search engines like Google, have become integral to our daily lives. Software engineering is vital because it not only powers these systems but also seems to drive innovation and improvements infinitely. Its role in advancing technology and solving complex problems makes it a field I am eager to be part of as well.

  But software can only be as good as long as there isn't anything that can damage or exploit it, which is why I’m also interested in the cybersecurity field. Cybersecurity is essential because it safeguards sensitive data and critical infrastructure from ever-evolving digital threats. As our reliance on technology grows, the potential for harmful security threats will only become increasingly severe, impacting everything from personal privacy to national security. The appeal of cybersecurity lies in its dynamic nature, requiring a constant adaptation to new threats and technologies. This field offers the intellectual challenge of outsmarting cyber adversaries and the opportunity to make a significant impact by protecting individuals and organizations from malicious attacks.

### Developing skills
  From these interests, I believe I can develop several key skills. Adaptability will be crucial as I learn to stay up-to-date with evolving technologies and digital threats in cybersecurity. Problem-solving skills are essential for programming and will help me address and resolve issues in both software engineering and security contexts. Additionally, engaging in software development can enhance my creativity and drive innovation.

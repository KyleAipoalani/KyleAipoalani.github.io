### Introduction to UI frameworks
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard foundational language used to create structures of webpages. It allows developers to define the organization of content on a page by using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. In HTML, developers use tags like < html >, < body >, < p >, to separate the code into different sections, helping browsers understand how to display the content. Some things that HTML can do is to be able to allow navigation between different web pages through hyperlinks, and embedding things like images, audio. And video. 

While HTML’s main purpose is to provide a web pages structure, another framework compliments HTML by styling the page. That framework is called CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. CSS’ role in web design is to determine how elements like fonts, colors, spacing, and layouts are displayed. It allows developers to apply styles to individual elements or entire sections of a webpage by selecting HTML elements through selectors like class names or tags which were mentioned previously. CSS also supports responsive design, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, which is severely important in present-day web development. 

Bootstrap is similar to CSS in the way that it’s mainly used for styling and adding functionality to a web page quickly and efficiently. Bootstrap provides various pre-designed components like buttons, navigation bars, and icons, allowing for more control over the presentation of your web pages. One of the key advantages is that it simplifies web development by offering base templates which can be customized in any way to fit the needs of the page. Its utilization of a grid system allows developers to create page layouts that can dynamically adjust to various screen sizes. This makes it even more convenient to use so that you don’t have to worry about your page not functioning or looking properly on various devices. 

### Reflection
As an absolute beginner, HTML initially seemed quite intimidating. The syntax and use of tags were completely foreign to me, especially coming from a background in Java and C++, where most of my experience involved command-line tasks. However, as I spent more time with it, HTML’s simplicity in defining the foundation and structure of a webpage made the basics of web development easier to grasp. Transitioning into CSS and Bootstrap added a creative layer, allowing me to style and design each element to match my vision. As I became more comfortable with these frameworks, I learned the importance of maintaining clean and organized code, as well as focusing on one small task at a time. Trying to tackle too many things at once often left me feeling confused and overwhelmed by the complexity of the code. Overall, working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap has given me a solid foundation in web development, and I’m excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in the field.

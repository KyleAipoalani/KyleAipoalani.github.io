### Importance of Coding Standards
  One of the biggest reasons coding standards are so important is that they promote consistency and clarity across entire programs. For instance in larger projects, multiple developers may work on the same files or modules, and without a uniform set of rules, the code can quickly become a mess of conflicting styles. Individuals on a team will write code their own unique ways, leading to inconsistencies that make the code harder to read, maintain, and debug. Consistency ensures that anyone can step into a project and understand the structure of the code without having to decipher individual quirks or habits. This not only makes collaboration easier but also helps when debugging and/or scaling the project over time. Coding standards also promote best practices by encouraging the use of clear variable names and efficient logic, which helps prevent common errors. They also contribute to improved performance and scalability, both of which are essential for the long-term success of any kind of software. At the end of the day, coding standards make it easier to work collaboratively, maintain high-quality code, and streamline development processes, which is why they are so important in any software engineering environment.

### Reflection
  This semester, we began using ESLint with VSCode in our assignments, and I’ve had the chance to experience coding standards in a new way. At first, seeing so many ESLint errors pop up was overwhelming. Even minor things like spacing was an issue, which at first glance thought that the program itself just wasn’t correctly put together. It felt tedious to go through and fix every small thing the tool flagged. Yet, as I spent more time addressing those issues, I realized that ESLint wasn’t just enforcing random and wild rules. Each rule was teaching me something about the language—whether it was better syntax, avoiding common mistakes, or writing more efficient code.

  That said, fixing those errors is not fun. It is especially not fun when I felt like my code worked perfectly well, yet ESLint insisted on changes. But in the long run, I believe that coding standards not only produce cleaner, more maintainable code but also help programmers internalize the best practices of a language and to work more cohesively within a group no matter the size. So while getting rid of ESLint errors can be both painful and useful, I see it as an essential step toward becoming a better developer.
